Description: An automatic cell type detection and assignment algorithm for single cell RNA-Seq and Cytof/FACS data. SCINA is capable of assigning cell type identities to a pool of cells profiled by scRNA-Seq or Cytof/FACS data with prior knowledge of markers, such as genes and protein symbols that are highly or lowly expressed in each category. See Ze Z, Danni L, et al (2018) for more details.
